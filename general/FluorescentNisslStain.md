## Perfusion, Embedding, Sectioning
1. Transcardially perfuse with ice-cold saline following by 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2–7.3). Postfix overnight with the same fixative.
2. Embed in 4% agarose.
3. Section the brain via vibratome into 50 µm-thick slices and harvest them in 12 well plates containing saline or PBS.
4. PBS wash.

## Fluorescent immunostaining (optional)

## Staining (Room temperature, Light shielding)
5. PBS-X, 10 min shaking.
6. PBS wash.
7. Incubate with diluted NeuroTrace solution for 40 min (Blue, Green) or 60 min (Red) for 40µm sections (20 min for <12 µm sections)
8. PBS wash.

## Mounting
9. Mount on gelatin-coated glass slides.
10. Air-dry (30 min).

## Cover-slipping
11. Coverslip with 50% (v/v) glycerol/2.5% (w/v) DABCO in PBS.

## Observation
12. Observe with confocal microscopy or epifluorescence microscopy.
