## Injection
1. Mount isoflurane anesthetized rat on a stereotaxic frame
1. Fill mineral oil into a Drummond glass capillary of which tip is 10-20 µm
1. Set the capillary onto the Nanoject II injector and fill 10% BDA solution about 1.0 µl
1. Advance the capillary to the target brain region and wait for a while (> 5 min)
1. Inject total 0.3 µl BDA by applying 65 pulses at 0.2 Hz (4.6 nl / pulse)
1. Wait for a while and retract the capillary gently
1. Suture skins on the skull and house the rat normally for one week

## Perfusion, Embedding, Sectioning
1. Transcardially perfuse with cool saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2–7.3). Postfix overnight with the same fixative
1. Infiltrate with 30% sucrose solution in PBS
1. Section the brain with a cryostat into 40 to 50-µm-thick slices and harvest them in 24-well plates containing anti-freeze solution

## Streptavidin solution (Room temperature, Light shielding)
1. PBS wash.
1. PBS-X, 30 min on shaker
1. Streptavidin solution for 2 h on shaker
1. PB wash
1. 1 µg/ml DAPI in PB for 15 min on shaker
1. PBS wash

## Mounting
1. Mount on gelatin or MAS-coated glass slides
1. Air-dry (30 min)

## Cover-slipping
1. Coverslip with 50% (v/v) glycerol/2.5% (w/v) DABCO in PBS

## Observation
1. Observe with confocal microscopy or epifluorescence microscopy
